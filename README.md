ðŸ“± Google Playstore Apps Rating Prediction
This project aims to predict the ratings of apps on the Google Playstore using data analysis and machine learning techniques. It explores the impact of various features like app category, number of installs, size, and more on user ratings.

ðŸš€ Project Overview
Goal: Predict app ratings using machine learning models.

Dataset: Google Playstore data (publicly available dataset).

Tech Stack: Python, Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn, Jupyter Notebook.

ðŸ“Š Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Data cleaning (handling missing values, duplicates, outliers).

Visualization of:

Rating distribution
